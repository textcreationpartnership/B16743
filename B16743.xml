            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIs Majestie having by the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> received a Petition for Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the High Court of Parliament, wherein was an humble Remonstrance of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, both on His Majesties part and their own, wherein they solemnly protested that if His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie would be graciously pleased to condiscend to their Just, Honourable, and necessary requests, they would lay down all preparations of War, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render His Majesties Magazin into His Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and that all their Counsells and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations should be imployed to Advance His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, and to Crown Him with more Honour then ever was enjoyed by any of His Perdecessors.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:197384:3"/>
            <p>Notwithstanding His Majestie being seduced by some that are greatly feated to be Enemies to the Kingdom, was pleased to return this Answer to the Petitioners, and to propound these following Propositions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they would recall the Ordinance of the the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they would deliver up His Majesties Magazine taken from <hi>Hull,</hi> be forthwith put into hands in which His Majestie may confide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That His Navy be surrenderd by the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> to Sir <hi>John pennington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That all Arms, Leavies, and Provisions for War, made by the consent of both Houses be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly layd down.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Parliament might be adjourned to some place where His Majestie might with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity come neer them, and joyne with them in their consultations.</p>
            <p>To these His Propositions, He added this His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, Declaring, that if these His Propositions shall be rejected, His Majestie not doubting of the protection, and assistance of Almightie God, and the ready concurrence of His good Subjects, who can have no hope left them of enjoying their own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197384:3"/> long, if their King may be oppressed and spoiled, and must be remedilesse; &amp; though His Towns, His Ships, His Arms, And His Money begotten and taken from Him, He hath a good cause left, and the hearts of His People, with which He doubts not but with Gods blessing to recover all the rest: Lastly, if the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the defence of the Liberty, and the Law of the Kingdom, the Dignitie and Freedom of Parliament,</p>
            <p>Be Equally precious to the Petitioners, as they are to His Maiestie (who will have no quarrell but in defence of these) there will be a cheerefull and speedy consent to what His Majestie hath proposed, and desired.</p>
            <p>And of this his Majestie expects a full and reall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by Wednesday the Twenty seven of this Instant <hi>July,</hi> till then He will not make any attempt of force upon <hi>Hull,</hi> hoping in the Duty, and Loyalty of the Petitioners: And in the meane time expects that no supply of men be put into <hi>Hull,</hi> or any of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties goods taken from thence.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons having received this unexpected Answer, set down their Resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same, in these ensuing Votes.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
